My main area of interest are Partial Differential Equations with a particular focus on equations related to fluid dynamics. I was a recipient of a 2019 Clay Research Award. My research is supported by the National Science Foundation grant DMS-1900149 'Analytic Methods in Hydrodynamic and Wave Turbulence', the Simons Foundation Mathematical and Physical Sciences collaborative grant 'Wave Turbulence' and a grant from the Insitute for Advanced Study.
