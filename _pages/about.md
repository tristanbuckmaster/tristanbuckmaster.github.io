My current research is divided into three projects:
<ul>
<li><i>Singularity formation and development for compressible fluid</i></li>
<li><i>Self-similar blowup for incompressible fluid</i></li>
<li><i>Development of a mathematically rigorous framework for the theory of wave turbulence</i></li>
</ul>
Previously, stemming from my doctoral work, I worked on applying the technique of convex-integration to prove non-uniqueness results for weak solutions to fluid equations. For my joint work with Vlad Vicol on non-uniqueness of weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes, I was awarded the <a href="https://www.claymath.org/events/news/2019-clay-research-awards">2019 Clay Research Award</a> (joint with Vlad Vicol and Philip Isett).

My research is currently supported through following grants:
<ul>
<li>National Science Foundation grant <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2243205">DMS-2243205 'CAREER: Singularities in fluids'</a></li>
<li>National Science Foundation grant <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2244879">DMS-2244879 'FRG: Collaborative Research: Singularities in Incompressible Flows: Computer Assisted Proofs and Physics-Informed Neural Networks'</a></li>
<li>Simons Foundation Mathematical and Physical Sciences collaborative grant <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/wave-turbulence/">'Wave Turbulence'</a></li>
</ul>
