My current research is divided into three projects:
<ul>
<li>Singularity formation and development for compressible fluid</li>
<li>Self-similar blowup for incompressible fluid</li>
<li>Development of a mathematically rigorous framework for the theory of wave turbulence</li>
</ul>
Previously, steming from my doctoral work, I worked on applying the technique of convex-integration to prove non-uniqueness results for weak solutions to fluid equations. For my joint work with Vlad Vicol on non-uniqueness of weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes, I was awarded the 2019 Clay Research Award (joint with Vlad Vicol and Philip Isett).

My research is currently supported through following grants
<ul>
<li>National Science Foundation grant DMS-1900149 'Analytic Methods in Hydrodynamic and Wave Turbulence'</li>
<li>Simons Foundation Mathematical and Physical Sciences collaborative grant 'Wave Turbulence'</li>
</ul>
