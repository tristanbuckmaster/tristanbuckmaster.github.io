My current research is divided into three projects:
<ul>
<li><i>Singularity formation and development for compressible fluid</i></li>
<li><i>Self-similar blowup for incompressible fluid</i></li>
<li><i>Development of a mathematically rigorous framework for the theory of wave turbulence</i></li>
</ul>
Previously, steming from my doctoral work, I worked on applying the technique of convex-integration to prove non-uniqueness results for weak solutions to fluid equations. For my joint work with Vlad Vicol on non-uniqueness of weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes, I was awarded the <a href="https://www.claymath.org/events/news/2019-clay-research-awards">2019 Clay Research Award</a> (joint with Vlad Vicol and Philip Isett).

My research is currently supported through following grants:
<ul>
<li>National Science Foundation grant <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1900149">DMS-1900149 'Analytic Methods in Hydrodynamic and Wave Turbulence'</a></li>
<li>Simons Foundation Mathematical and Physical Sciences collaborative grant <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/wave-turbulence/">'Wave Turbulence'</a></li>
</ul>
