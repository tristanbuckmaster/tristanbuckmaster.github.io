	abstract = {The present work considers systems whose dynamics are governed by the nonlinear interactions
among groups of 6 nonlinear waves, such as those described by the unforced quintic nonlinear Schr{\ ̈o}dinger equation. Specific parameter regimes in which ensemble-averaged dynamics of such systems with finite size are accurately described by a wave kinetic equation, as used in wave turbulence theory, are theoretically predicted. In addition, the underlying reasons that the wave kinetic equation may be a poor predictor of wave dynamics outside these regimes are also discussed. These theoretical predictions are directly verified by comparing ensemble averages of solutions to the dynamical equation with corresponding solutions of the wave kinetic equation.},

	title = {Simultaneous development of shocks and cusps for 2{D} {E}uler with azimuthal symmetry from smooth data},
	abstract = {A fundamental question in fluid dynamics concerns the formation of discontinuous shock waves from smooth initial data. We prove that from smooth initial data, smooth solutions to the 2d Euler equations in azimuthal symmetry form a first singularity, the so-called {$C^{\frac13}$} pre-shock. The solution in the vicinity of this pre-shock is shown to have a fractional series expansion with coefficients computed from the data. Using this precise description of the pre-shock, we prove that a discontinuous shock instantaneously develops after the pre-shock. This regular shock solution is shown to be unique in a class of entropy solutions with azimuthal symmetry and regularity determined by the pre-shock expansion. Simultaneous to the development of the shock front, two other characteristic surfaces of cusp-type singularities emerge from the pre-shock. These surfaces have been termed weak discontinuities by Landau \& Lifschitz [Chapter IX, \S 96], who conjectured some type of singular behavior of derivatives along such surfaces. We prove that along the slowest surface, all fluid variables except the entropy have {$C^{1,\frac12}$} one-sided cusps from the shock side, and that the normal velocity is decreasing in the direction of its motion; we thus term this surface a weak rarefaction wave. Along the surface moving with the fluid velocity, density and entropy form $C^{1,\frac12}$ one-sided cusps while the pressure and normal velocity remain $C^2$; as such, we term this surface a weak contact discontinuity.},

In the hydrodynamical context, these methods produce paradoxical solutions to the fluid equations which defy physical laws. These counterintuitive solutions have a number of properties that resemble predictions made by phenomenological theories of fluid turbulence. The goal of this review is to highlight some of these similarities while maintaining an emphasis on rigorous mathematical statements. We focus our attention on the construction of weak solutions for the incompressible Euler, Navier–Stokes, and magneto-hydrodynamic equations which violate these systems’ physical energy laws.},

More specifically, we construct initial data that when viewed in self-similar coordinates, converges asymptotically to the unstable $C^{\frac15}$ self-similar solution to the Burgers' equation. Moreover, we show the behavior is stable in $C^8$ modulo a two dimensional linear subspace. Under the azimuthal symmetry assumption, one cannot impose additional symmetry assumptions in order to isolate the corresponding manifold of initial data leading to stability: rather, we rely on modulation variable techniques in conjunction with a Newton scheme.},

@article{buckmaster2020shock,
	abstract={We analyze the shock formation process for the 3d non-isentropic Euler equations with the ideal gas law, in which sounds waves interact with entropy waves to produce vorticity. Building on our theory for isentropic flows in [3,4], we give a constructive proof of shock formation from smooth initial data. Specifically, we prove that there exist smooth solutions to the non-isentropic Euler equations which form a generic stable shock with explicitly computable blowup time, location, and direction. This is achieved by establishing the asymptotic stability of a generic shock profile in modulated self-similar variables, controlling the interaction of wave families via: (i) pointwise bounds along Lagrangian trajectories, (ii) geometric vorticity structure, and (iii) high-order energy estimates in Sobolev spaces.},

We prove that for an open set of Sobolev-class initial data which are a small $L^\infty$ perturbation of a constant state, there exist smooth solutions to the Euler equations which form a generic stable shock in finite time. The blow up time and location can be explicitly computed, and solutions at the blow up time are smooth except for a single point, where they are of cusp-type with H{\"o}lder $C^{\frac13}$ regularity.

	abstract = {We consider the 2D isentropic compressible Euler equations, with pressure law $p(\rho) = (\frac{1}{\gamma}) \rho^\gamma$, with γ>1. We provide an elementary constructive proof of shock formation from smooth initial datum of finite energy, with no vacuum regions, and with {nontrivial vorticity}. We prove that for initial data which has minimum slope $- {\frac{1}{ \eps}}$, for $\eps>0$ taken sufficiently small relative to the $O(1)$ amplitude, there exist smooth solutions to the Euler equations which form a shock in time $O(\eps)$. The blowup time and location can be explicitly computed and solutions at the blowup time are of cusp-type, with Hölder $C^ {\frac{1}{3}}$ regularity.
Our objective is the construction of solutions with inherent $O(1)$ vorticity at the shock. As such, rather than perturbing from an irrotational regime, we instead construct solutions with dynamics dominated by purely azimuthal wave motion. We consider homogenous solutions to the Euler equations and use Riemann-type variables to obtain a system of forced transport equations. Using a transformation to modulated self-similar variables and pointwise estimates for the ensuing system of transport equations, we show the global stability, in self-similar time, of a smooth blowup profile.},

@article{Buckmaster2020,
	abstract = {In this review article we discuss a number of recent results concerning {\em wild} weak solutions of the incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. These results build on the groundbreaking works of De Lellis and Sz\'ekelyhidi Jr., who extended Nash's fundamental ideas on $C^1$ flexible isometric embeddings, into the realm of fluid dynamics. These techniques, which go under the umbrella name {\em convex integration}, have fundamental analogies with the phenomenological theories of hydrodynamic turbulence [51,54,55,200]. Mathematical problems arising in turbulence (such as the Onsager conjecture) have not only sparked new interest in convex integration, but certain experimentally observed features of turbulent flows (such as intermittency) have also informed new convex integration constructions. 

First, we give an elementary construction of nonconservative $C^{0+}_{x,t}$ weak solutions of the Euler equations, first proven by De~Lellis-Sz\'ekelyhidi Jr.~[52,53].. Second, we  present Isett's~[108]  recent resolution of the flexible side of the Onsager conjecture. Here, we in fact follow the joint work~[21] of De~Lellis-Sz\'ekelyhidi Jr.~and the authors of this paper, in which weak solutions of the Euler equations in the regularity class $C^{\frac 13-}_{x,t}$ are constructed, attaining any energy profile. Third, we give a concise proof of the authors' recent result~[23], which proves the existence of infinitely many weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes in the regularity class $C^0_t L^{2+}_x \cap C^0_t W^{1,1+}_x$. We conclude the article by mentioning a number of open problems at the intersection of convex integration and hydrodynamic turbulence.},

@article{BDLISZ15,
	abstract ={Recently the second and fourth authors developed an iterative scheme for obtaining rough solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations in H\"older spaces. The motivation comes from Onsager’s conjecture. The construction involves a superposition of weakly interacting perturbed Beltrami flows on infinitely many scales. An obstruction to better regularity arises from the errors in the linear transport of a fast periodic flow by a slow velocity field.
In a recent paper the third author has improved upon the methods, introducing some novel ideas on how to deal with this obstruction, thereby reaching a better H\"older exponent — albeit weaker than the one conjectured by Onsager. In this paper we give a shorter proof of this final result, adhering more to the original scheme of the second and fourth authors and introducing some new devices. More precisely we show that for any positive $\epsilon$, there exist periodic solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations that dissipate the total kinetic energy and belong to the H\"older class $C^{\frac15-\epsilon}$.},
